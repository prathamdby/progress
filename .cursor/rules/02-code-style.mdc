# Code Style Guide

## TypeScript/JavaScript Conventions

1. Use TypeScript for all new code
2. Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
3. Use arrow functions for consistency
4. Implement proper error handling with try/catch blocks
5. Use async/await over .then() chains

## React Best Practices

1. Use functional components with hooks
2. Implement proper prop types using TypeScript interfaces
3. Keep components focused and single-responsibility
4. Use meaningful component and variable names
5. Extract reusable logic into custom hooks

## File Naming Conventions

1. Use PascalCase for component files: `Button.tsx`
2. Use kebab-case for utility files: `use-auth.ts`
3. Use index.ts for barrel exports
4. Group related components in subdirectories

## Import/Export Guidelines

1. Use named exports for utilities and components
2. Group imports by type (React, components, utilities)
3. Avoid default exports except for pages
4. Use absolute imports with proper path aliases

## Comments and Documentation

1. Use JSDoc for component props and functions
2. Keep comments focused and meaningful
3. Document complex business logic
4. Use TODO comments for future improvements
